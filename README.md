# **Hangman Game**
Welcome to our Hangma game project developed as a part of our university course. This project aims to create a simple word-guessing game using GO and JavaScript. 

**Overview**
The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game that challenges players to guess a word letter by letter. The game provides a visual representation of a hangman figure, and players have a maximum of six incorrect guesses befre they lose.
