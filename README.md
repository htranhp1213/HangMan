# **Hangman Game**
Welcome to our Hangman game project developed as part of our college course. This project aims to create a simple word-guessing game using Go and JavaScript.

## Overview:
The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game that challenges players to guess a word letter by letter. The game provides a visual representation of a hangman figure, and players have a maximum of six incorrect guesses before they lose.

3. Start guessing letters by clicking on the on-screen keyboard or typing on your physical keyboard.
